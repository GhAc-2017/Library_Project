This is a Library Management Software made with love by A.C.TECH. Here we have a library where the students and teachers have access to books, though with different rights (discussed later). We have a log in system by virtue of which our user gets access of the books, or a new user can register through our Registration portal. This software contains many forms with different functionalities. Even a user visiting our system for the first time can see through our books, but cannot issue one unless he/she registers to  our portal.
Now once he logs in to the system he has different range of rules to follow up. One User can keep a book upto 15 days, After which he/she will have to pay fine. And most importantly, if there is fine due in someone’s account he loses access to all functionalities unless he/she pays the fine and return all the books, and then only he can start journey in our system again afresh.

Now coming to fine structure a student have to pay Rs.1/day and a teacher have to pay Rs.2/day after the 15 days period is over. Once any amount of fine is imposed to a user, he will have to pay the fine right away to regain his access to all the features in our system.

And one other important thing any one cannot be registered as an Admin through normal Registration Process, Only One Admin can register another admin through his account logged in as Administrator.

And if any user seeks to change his profile information, he only way to do this is by contacting the administrator

The password set in the time of registration will be considered as final password and cannot be changed later on..

Coming to the no of books a user can issue at a time is 
Student->3 Books at a time   &&    Teachers->2 Books at a time 

And the Most interesting part is that we have our own Payment   Gateway->>”payTech”  to pay the due fines And once  a new user registers to our system, he/she automatically gets a payTech account(which needs to be primarily filled with some amount of cash to get the full functionality of the library for a user, because at the time of fine payment amount will be deducted from that account)

THANKING YOU                                                                                    AYAN CHOWDHURY
